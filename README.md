# Chat Support Analyzer

#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QfIog9F6_k

#### Description:

A text analysis app for customer support specialists, which detects sentiments, tone and language to decide whether they are formal and polite or are rude to the customers.

If the app detects that the customer support specialist is rude 3 times, it will get flagged in the system and their immediate manager will receive a notification.

The algorithm uses the Watson Natural Language Understanding API from IBM to get the language score and outputs it visually as a slider, a line chart and a sentiment text to the customer support specialist.
